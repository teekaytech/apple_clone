In this project, my aim wasn’t to produce an exact replica of the archived apple.com page, but rather to focus on how to align all elements with float and flex or grid in CSS. That means two things – laying out the basic structure of the page using semantic HTML elements and ensuring that the elements are appropriately sized and positioned.

Some of the elements in the said archive are produced with Javascript but my objective in this project wasn't to give this page functionality, so nothing nothing else is clickable.

## Built with
  * HTML 
  * CSS (Box Model, Grid, Flex and Float)
  * Lint (Stickler)
  * W3C Validator

## Getting started
**I cloned an archived copy of Apple website. The main aim is to ensure the elements get placed and styled roughly the same way as the source, so functionality is not a priority.**

I used the browser’s developer tools to inspect the archived apple website to understand how elements are placed and styled.
I built my own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. I carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
  - Then open the archived web page at https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/, inspect its features with browser's developer tools and start creating  :shipit:
